This script focuses on optimizing and cleaning WIN OS systems (7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11). Each section is cataloged and can be commented on in order to remove it and adapt it to your needs. Feel free to modify and contribute to this project, which aims to make day-to-day maintenance of embedded WIN OS easier.

Thank's for reding!
